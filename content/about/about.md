Hi, my name is Martin. Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I've just finished my degree in computer science from the University of Copenhagen. I'm a full-stack developer primarily specialized in Javascript runtimes which I've worked with in during my student job and in my side projects. I enjoy the process of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life.

I like to keep things simple and that's kind of the philosophy I apply to everything I do within the realm of software.

My hobbies include watching movies, playing video games, reading books, and more recently baking bread (which I'm sadly still pretty bad, but hey, it takes practice!).
