Hi, my name is Martin. Thanks for checking out my portfolio. At the moment, I'm a student at the University of Copenhagen. Outside of academia, I'm a fullstack developer primarily working in Javascript runtimes, both in my student job and for side projects. I enjoy the process of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life.

I like to keep things simple and that's kind of the philosophy I apply to everything I do within the realm of software.

My hobbies include playing video games, watching movies, reading books, and more recently baking bread (which I'm sadly still pretty bad at).
