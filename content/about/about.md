Hi, my name is Martin. I'm currently studying computer science at the University of Copenhagen but outside of studying I spend time nerding mostly over web technologies and building things using them. I enjoy the process of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life.

I like to keep things simple and that's kind of the philosophy I apply to everything I do within the realm of software.

My hobbies include playing video games, watching movies, reading books, and more recently baking bread (which I'm sadly still pretty bad at).
